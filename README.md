Description coming soon

## Getting Started
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) globally on your machine.
2. Run `run-docker.sh`-script or call the corresponding commands manually. This can take a while at the first start. `npm install` is not required as the build is done within the docker instance.
3. You can now connect to the webserver via `http://localhost`
