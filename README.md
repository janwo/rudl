# Rudl - Web App üê∫
*Conception, Implementation and Evaluation of an application for the simplification of leisure design*

This project was an important part of my master thesis. In our society, digitization manifested an ‚Äúalways on‚Äù paradegima of constant accessibility and quick answers. The goal in this project was the conception of an application which contradicts the paradigm. A possible set-up was presented to motivate the reduction of online time in favor of offline time.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) globally on your machine.
2. Run `run-docker.sh`-script or call the corresponding commands manually. This can take a while at the first start. `npm install` is not required as the build is done within the docker instance.
3. You can now connect to the webserver via `http://localhost`
