## Getting Started
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) globally on your machine.
2. Run `npm start`, this can take a while at the first start. `npm install` is not required as the build is done within the docker instance.
3. You can now connect to the webserver via `http://localhost`
